## 2. Inferential Statistics on Diabetes

Learn how to make inferences about population, We always work with sample of data, When we make inferences about population we should always consider standard estimated error. I will be finding mean and proportion of different variables with 95% confidence Interval in this Notebook.

## 4. Natural Language Processing with Python

Natural language processing (NLP) is about developing applications and services that are able to understand human languages. Some Practical examples of NLP are speech recognition for eg: google voice search, understanding what the content is about or sentiment analysis etc.

## 5. Predictive Modelling (KNN,ANN,XGBoost)

Predictive modeling uses statistics to predict outcomes. Most often the event one wants to predict is in the future, but predictive modelling can be applied to any type of unknown event, regardless of when it occurred.

## 6. Multivariate Statistical Analysis on Diabetes

Multivariate analysis is based on the principles of multivariate statistics, which involves observation and analysis of more than one statistical outcome variable at a time.

## 7. COVID19 India Report (EDA + Statistical Test)

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.Most people who fall sick with COVID-19 will experience mild to moderate symptoms and recover without special treatment.

## 8. Univariate Statistical Analysis on Diabetes

Univariate analysis is perhaps the simplest form of statistical analysis. Like other forms of statistics, it can be inferential or descriptive. The key fact is that only one variable is involved. Univariate analysis can yield misleading results in cases in which multivariate analysis is more appropriate.

## 10. (99% Acc.) Inception V3 on Rock, Paper & Scissor

I will use PreTrained Model Inception Netowrk to train my model. Off Course because we need to go deeper :) Inceptionv3 is a convolutional neural network for assisting in image analysis and object detection, and got its start as a module for Googlenet. It is the third edition of Google's Inception Convolutional Neural Network, originally introduced during the ImageNet Recognition Challenge. Just as ImageNet can be thought of as a database of classified visual objects, Inception helps classification of objects in the world of computer vision. One such use is in life sciences, where it aids in the research of Leukemia. It was "codenamed 'Inception' after the film of the same name".

## 11. Time Series Descriptive Statistics and Tests

There are different forecasting models like ARMA, ARIMA, Seasonal ARIMA and others. Each model addresses a different type of time series. For this reason, in order to select an appropriate model we need to know something about the data.In this section we'll learn how to determine if a time series is stationary, if it's independent, and if two series demonstrate correlation and/or causality.

## 12. Extracting Dominant Color of an Image

Clustering is used in much real-world application, one such real-world example of clustering is extracting dominant colors from an image.
Any image consists of pixels, each pixel represents a dot in an image. A pixel contains three values and each value ranges between 0 to 255, representing the amount of red, green and blue components. The combination of these forms an actual color of the pixel. To find the dominant colors, the concept of the k-means clustering is used. One important use of k-means clustering is to segment satellite images to identify surface features.
