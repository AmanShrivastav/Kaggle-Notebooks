# Jupyter Notebooks
Hello User,
I am a Kaggle Notebook Master. You can learn to plot, make intelligent models and many more with my Notebooks. I have explained codes and work as well using Jupyter Markdown. All source code are available on GitHub as well as on Kaggle. Please use Linke provided below for Data.

## 2. Inferential Statistics on Diabetes

Learn how to make inferences about population, We always work with sample of data, When we make inferences about population we should always consider standard estimated error. I will be finding mean and proportion of different variables with 95% confidence Interval in this Notebook.

## 4. Natural Language Processing with Python

Natural language processing (NLP) is about developing applications and services that are able to understand human languages. Some Practical examples of NLP are speech recognition for eg: google voice search, understanding what the content is about or sentiment analysis etc.

## 5. Predictive Modelling (KNN,ANN,XGBoost)

Predictive modeling uses statistics to predict outcomes. Most often the event one wants to predict is in the future, but predictive modelling can be applied to any type of unknown event, regardless of when it occurred.

## 6. Multivariate Statistical Analysis on Diabetes

Multivariate analysis is based on the principles of multivariate statistics, which involves observation and analysis of more than one statistical outcome variable at a time.

## 7. COVID19 India Report (EDA + Statistical Test)

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.Most people who fall sick with COVID-19 will experience mild to moderate symptoms and recover without special treatment.

## 8. Univariate Statistical Analysis on Diabetes

Univariate analysis is perhaps the simplest form of statistical analysis. Like other forms of statistics, it can be inferential or descriptive. The key fact is that only one variable is involved. Univariate analysis can yield misleading results in cases in which multivariate analysis is more appropriate.
